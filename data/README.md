### Description about the Dataset


We will be using the dataset called **Humicroedit** which was provided by the competition organizers. It was created by taking news headlines and making micro-edits i.e. replacing one or two words in the headline text in order to introduce humor in the news content. 

There are about 5,000 distinct news headlines, each having 3 edited versions, thus totaling about 15,000 records. The data is partitioned into 3 subsets, the Train Dataset with about 64% records, the Dev Dataset with about 16% records, and the Test Dataset with 20% of the records. 

The training data can be found in the file [train.csv](train.csv), the dev dataset file is named [dev.csv](dev.csv), and the test data with truth labels can be found in the file [truth_task_1.csv](truth_task_1.csv).
