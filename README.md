### Task Description:

We are attempting the SemEval-2020 Task 7 (Assessing Humor in Edited News Headlines) Subtask 1 . 

In this task, we try to predict the mean humor rating for news articles that were edited by replacing a word in their original content. Our aim would be to develop a sentence-pair regression model that takes both the original news headline and the edited news headline as input and then outputs a prediction of a mean funniness rating in the range of 0 to 3 for each edited news article. The predicted real-valued scores would represent the humor content as following:
0 representing “Not Funny”, 1 representing “Slightly Funny”, 2 representing “Moderately Funny” and 3 representing “Very Funny”.
