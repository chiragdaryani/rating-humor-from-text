**All the results mentioned in the project report are captured in the ipynb notebooks that we uploaded in the code directory.** 
There you can see the output of each cell that was executed.

We are also uploading the following files here:

* `bow-output.csv`: Predictions of the best performing model on Test Data represented as Bag of Words (BoW) vectorized features.

* `tfidf-output.csv`: Predictions of the best performing model on Test Data represented as TF-IDF vectorized features.

* `word2vec-output.csv`: Predictions of the best performing model on Test Data represented as Word2vec vectorized features.

**All these files were created from the execution of the jupyter notebooks uploaded in the code section.**
